## About Easypass
- Easypass is a module made with python that automates the process of getting the LAUSD [Dailypass](https://pap.lausd.net/en-US/).
- This module uses other few modules to interact with the [Dailypass](https://pap.lausd.net/en-US/) website, it uses modules such as [selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) and [email](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.html).
- The code is completely open-sourced and I give you complete permission to take the code and figure out how it works or make it better.

## Requirements
- Alternate Gmail Account
- [Github](https://github.com/) Account
- [Replit](https://replit.com/) Account
- [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) Account
- A phone number where you can receive your dailypass

## Is this allowed?
- Yes this is very much allowed, The browser is automated and google chrome flags it as automated, and the [Dailypass](https://pap.lausd.net/en-US/)  doesn't do anything to avoid automated browsers so it's totally safe to use this.

## How to use it
1. I'm going to assume that you already have a alternate Gmail account, [Github](https://github.com/), [Replit](https://replit.com/) and [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/)  setup already. If you are unaware of how to do so, here are some videos that will help you out.

	- [Github Account Creation Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Di-ZfcBDXU)
	- [Replit Account Creation Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnTcdgyan0o)
	- [UptimeRobot Account Creation Link](https://uptimerobot.com/signUp)
2. Now that you have all your accounts setup first we will need to to setup 2-Step on your Gmail account. Here is a detailed video on how to do so.
	- [Stepup 2-Step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJKWDDj1Wgw)
3. Now we will have to create an app password that google will allow you to login with on your bot. To do so go to [App passwords in the security tab or the manage page of your account or click on this link.](http://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
	- You should see something like this:![](https://github.com/workframes/Easypass-Replit/blob/main/Images/app_password_v1.png?raw=true)
	- For `Select app` choose the option as `Other(Custom name)`. 
	- For the textbox put in `PC` . ![](https://github.com/workframes/Easypass-Replit/blob/main/Images/app_password_v2.png?raw=true)
	-  Then procced to click `GENERATE`, this will generate a password. Please save this password on a notepad as you will use this later on. ![](https://github.com/workframes/Easypass-Replit/blob/main/Images/app_password_v3.png?raw=true)
